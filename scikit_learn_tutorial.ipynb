    "### What is Scikit-learn?\n",
    "Scikit-learn (AKA sk-learn) is written in Python, an open source project, and is **one of the most used ML libraries today**. Sk-learn is built on top of Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and contains tons of algorithms ready to use to train, evaluate, and save models straight out of the box!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why learn Scikit-learn?\n",
    "With sk-learn, we don’t need to implement complex algorithms built on a backbone of linear algebra and statistics. By using sk-learn’s ML algorithms and neural networks, we can build models faster while getting familiar with industry-standard tools."

    "Scikit-learn provides tools to do that via built-in datasets, dataset loading utilities, and data preprocessing functions (like [train_test_split](https://sklearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n",

    "### Features and Labels\n",
    "In machine learning, we use data to train models to make predictions or decisions. This data is typically structured into two main parts:\n",
    "1. **Features (Input)**\n",
    "- Features are the input variables (also called independent variables) that the model uses to learn.\n",
    "- Think of them as the measurable properties or characteristics representing what causes or correlates to your output\n",
    "- Features are real numbers or are non-numeric and have been transformed into a numerical representation\n",
    "\n",

    "### B. Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "For many machine learning models, especially those that rely on distance calculations (like [KNN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors-classification) or [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification)), it's important to scale your features so they are on a similar scale. These models work by calculating distances between data points, and if one feature has a much larger range of values than others, it can dominate the distance calculations and lead to suboptimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other models, like [logistic regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) and [neural networks](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html#neural-networks-supervised), also benefit from feature scaling as it can lead to faster optimization during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common methods for feature scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardization**\n",
    "  - Transforms each feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1\n",
    "  - Especially useful for algorithms that assume a Gaussian or Normal distribution of the data\n",
    "  - Uses the [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)\n",
    "- **Normalization**\n",
    "  - Scales each feature to a range between 0 and 1\n",
    "  - Useful when you want to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations\n",
    "  - Uses the [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html)\n",
    "- **Outlier-Robust Methods**\n",
    "  - If your data is prone to outliers, consider using techniques like [`RobustScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html) that are less sensitive to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more scalers, imputers, and other preprocessing techniques in scikit-learn's [`preprocessing`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/sklearn.preprocessing.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing) module.\n",
    "\n",
