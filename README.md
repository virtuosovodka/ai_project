# ai_project
This project explores how machine learning can detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data. With over 1.3 million records, our model analyzes spending patterns to identify anomalies that signal potential fraud.

We use a Random Forest classifier and Stratified Cross-Validation to ensure fair evaluation on this highly imbalanced dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model tuning, and performance metrics like ROC-AUC and precision-recall to assess real-world reliability.

Our goal: to design an AI-powered fraud detection system that is accurate, interpretable, and scalable — bridging the gap between financial security and machine learning innovation.
